While installing for the first time, 
this plugin will create two pages with slug `job-list` and 
`single-job-page`. If there is a conflict with slug
(the page already exists while installing for the first time)
it will create pages suffixed by number.
To get the exact page slug please check the `a09_jfg_list_page` option 
in options table as this plugin stores the accurate slug there.
